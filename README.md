## STORY BEHIND THE APP

_Before I and my team build this app, like always, 
we doing research to find the real problem before we give an option of solution 
by using technology._
***


The lack of photography knowledge leads to common mistakes that most new photographer do. 
One of the technical mistakes is the composition of photo. 

While most of digital photos are taken by camera phone, there will be limitation to shot the photo, such as automatic exposure that includes fixed aperture.

Therefore, to overcome the limitation that camera phone has, learning how to maximise element in photo composition is needed for people who want to take interesting photos with camera phone.

We came with a solution concept to build an app that provide camera tutorial with real time practice to learn composition of the photo. And we named it **Captry**.
